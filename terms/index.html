            Service other than the rights described in this paragraph.
          </p>

            You agree, and represent and warrant, that Your use of the Service,
            or any portion thereof, will be consistent with the foregoing
            license, covenants and restrictions and will neither infringe nor
            violate the rights of any other party or breach any contract or
            legal duty to any other parties. In addition, You agree that You
            will comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances
            relating to the Service or Your use of it, and You will be solely
            responsible for Your own individual violations of any of any such
            laws.

          <p>
            You are solely responsible for obtaining the equipment and
            telecommunication services necessary to access the Service, and all
            fees associated therewith (such as computing devices and Internet
            service provider and airtime charges).
          </p>
          <p>
            We retain the right to implement any changes to the Service (whether
            to unpaid or Premium Services) at any time, with or without notice.
            You acknowledge that a variety of Awesome actions may impair or
            prevent You from accessing the Service at certain times and/or in
            the same way, for limited periods or permanently, and agree that
            Awesome has no responsibility or liability as a result of any such
            actions or results, including, without limitation, for the deletion
            of, or failure to make available to You, any content or services.
          </p>

          <h2>Purchases</h2>
          <h3>Fees</h3>
          <p>
            Awesome may offer certain enhanced features of the Services which
            you can purchase as a monthly, quarterly or yearly subscription
            (“Subscription”). A description of features associated with
            Subscriptions is available via the Services. The amounts due and
            payable by you for a Subscription that you purchase through the
            Services will be presented to you before you place your order. If
            you choose to purchase a Subscription via the Services, you agree
            (a) to pay the applicable fees and any taxes; (b) that Awesome may
            charge your credit card for verification, pre-authorization and
            payment purposes if you purchase via the site, or if you purchase
            via the App, charge your account with the app store or distribution
            platform (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is
            made available (each, an “App Provider”); and (c) to bear any
            additional charges that your App Provider, bank or other financial
            service provider may levy on you as well as any taxes or fees that
            may apply to your order. You’ll receive a confirmation email after
            we confirm the payment for your order. Your order is not binding on
            Awesome until accepted and confirmed by Awesome. All payments made
            are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided
            in these Terms.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel & How to Cancel
            Your Subscription
          </h3>
          <p>
            All amounts are payable and charged, for monthly, quarterly or
            yearly subscriptions, at the beginning of the subscription and,
            because each such subscription renews automatically for an
            additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term
            until you cancel it, at the time of each renewal until you cancel.
            You must cancel your monthly or yearly Subscription before it renews
            to avoid the billing of the fees for the next Subscription period.
            If you purchase your Subscription via the Site, you can cancel the
            renewal of your subscription at any time by contacting us by email
            at hello@isjustawesome.com. If you purchase your Subscription via an
            App Provider, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription with
            the App Provider. You will not receive a refund for the fees you
            already paid for your current subscription period and you will
            continue to receive the Services ordered until the end of your
            current Subscription period. If you have any concerns or objections
            regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first and you
            agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or App Provider
            charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the
            matter directly with Awesome. Awesome reserves the right to not
            process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances, for
            example, if your credit card is declined, if we suspect the request
            or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Awesome deems
            appropriate in its sole discretion. Awesome also reserves the right,
            in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity in
            connection with your order. Awesome will either not charge you or
            refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.
          </p>

          <h3>Changes to Price Terms</h3>
          <p>
            Awesome reserves the right to change its pricing terms for
            Subscriptions at any time and Awesome will notify you in advance of
            such changes becoming effective. Changes to the pricing terms will
            not apply retroactively and will only apply for Subscription
            renewals after such changed pricing terms have been communicated to
            you. If you do not agree with the changes to Awesome pricing terms
            then you may choose not to renew your Subscription in accordance
            with the section “Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel
            & How to Cancel Your Subscription.”
          </p>

          <h3>Future Functionality</h3>
          <p>
            You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of
            any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or
            written public comments made by Awesome regarding future
            functionality or features.
          </p>

          <h2>Forums, Chat Spaces and Blogs</h2>
          <p>
            A number of Service features, such as the feature allowing You to
            share diet information with friends, and any chat areas and blogs,
            offer opportunities for sharing information with others (the
            “Interactive Features”). Awesome does not edit or control User
            Content that You and other Users post to or distribute through the
            Interactive Features, and will not be in any way responsible or
            liable for User Content. Awesome does not vet or control the Users
            or other individuals that use the Service or Interactive Features.
            Awesome shall not be liable for any loss or damage that any person
            may suffer as a result of using Interactive Features. All Users use
            the Interactive Features at their own risk. Users should exercise
            caution in interacting with unknown persons that they meet using the
            Interactive Features in the same way that they would exercise
            caution in the physical world.
          </p>

          <p>No User of any Interactive Feature shall:</p>

          <p>
            (a) use a Interactive Feature in violation of, or in connection with
            any violation of, any local, state, national or international laws;
            <br />
            (b) impersonate any person or entity, or forge or manipulate headers
            to disguise the origin of any User Content; <br />
            (c) except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, harvest or
            otherwise collect information about others, including email
            addresses, without their consent; <br />
            (d) post any material more than once or “spam”; or <br />
            (e) engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits any other
            person from using or enjoying any Interactive Feature, User Content,
            or the Service, or which, in Awesome’s sole judgment, exposes
            Awesome or any officer, director, employee or agent of Awesome (each
            an “Awesome Partner”) to any liability or detriment of any type.
          </p>

            Feature) any material that:
          </p>
          <p>
            (a) is libelous, defamatory, threatening, abusive, scandalous,

            (b) contains any advertising, promotional, solicitation or other
            commercial material;

            (d) infringes any copyright or violates any property rights, rights
            of privacy or publicity, or any other rights of any third party;
            <br />
            (e) contains any statement, formula, direction, recipe, prescription
            or other matter that involves a reasonably foreseeable risk of

          </p>

          <p>
            Neither You nor any other party may, without our prior written

            similar device to read or extract the Service or User Content by
            machine based or automated means.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h2>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
            Service shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration
            conducted in Wilmington, Delaware before a single arbitrator (the
            “Arbitrator”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
            the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) then in effect and
            the further procedures set forth herein. In the event that the
            American Arbitration Association is unavailable or unwilling to
            administer the arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree to a
            substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The
            Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all remedies
            authorized by law. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal
            Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq., and the laws of the State of
            Delaware without reference to principles of conflicts of laws.
            Notwithstanding any rules of the American Arbitration Association to
            the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual
            basis, and YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A
            REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS,
            OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION
            PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award
            rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding
            upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration
            proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall
            determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and
            expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may at Your option file
            an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims
            within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court
            has personal jurisdiction. Awesome does not hereby waive any defense
            that such jurisdiction may be lacking in Your state. Without
            derogation of the parties’ obligation to arbitrate as set forth
            herein, for any claims other than those in small claims court,
            jurisdiction for any court proceedings arising out of or relating to
            this Agreement or the Service shall be vested exclusively in, and
            venue shall be laid in, the state or federal courts sitting in
            Wilmington, Delaware, except that, following confirmation of an
            arbitration award in a state or federal court in Wilmington,
            Delaware, a judgment arising therefrom may be executed in any court
            of competent jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <h2>Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
          <p>
            No delay or omission by Awesome in exercising any of its rights
            occurring upon any noncompliance or default by You with respect to
            this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a
            waiver thereof, and a waiver by Awesome of any of the covenants,
            conditions or agreements to be performed by You will not be
            construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any
            other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. As used in
            this Agreement, “including” means “including but not limited to.” If
            any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
            jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement
            will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be
            valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to
            the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly
            provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement
            between You and Awesome regarding its subject matter, and supersedes
            all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written
            or oral, regarding such subject matter. You agree that the
            electronic text of this Agreement constitutes a writing and Your
            assent to the terms and conditions hereof constitutes a “signing”
            for all purposes. There shall be no third party beneficiaries to
            this Agreement other than Awesome Partners. In no event shall
            Awesome be liable for any failure to comply with this Agreement to
            the extent that such failure arises from factors outside Awesome’s
            reasonable control.
