        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h6>Last Updated: May 15, 2018</h6>

        <p>Protecting your privacy is really important to us. Accordingly, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our
          practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This
          Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible
          through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words
          used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have
          read and understand our Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information
          is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy
          Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification,
          and we’ll update the “Last Updated” date above to indicate when those changes will become effective.
        </p>

        <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
        <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the
          Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate
          our Services.
        </p>

        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your email
          address (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be
          able to access and collect your name and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.
          If you create an Account through the Services or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date
          of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Information Collected</h3>
        <p>In addition to the above personal information (“PII”), we collect standard information about Awesome users such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Personal Diet Data” that you enter, including, date of birth, height and weight, gender, and specific details
            of the foods and drinks that you consume, why you made certain choices and information from any other entry you
            might make.</li>
          <li>Photos and and details of the meals that you have saved using our Services.</li>
          <li>Email address and Awesome Password.</li>
          <li>IP addresses, browser type and your operating system.</li>
          <li>Pages visited on the Websites referring and exit pages, and the dates and times of the visits.</li>
          <li>Any additional information relating to you and your use of the Websites, Apps or Awesome Services that you provide
            to use directly through the Websites, Apps or Awesome Services.</li>
          <li>Information that you make publicly available or publicly post using tools made available on the Websites or via
            the App.</li>
          <li>Information you may provide in user-to-user messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</h3>
        <p>Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to
          collect certain information. “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when
          you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged
          in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor
          aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent
          cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers
          automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to
          prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able
          to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including
          third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers
          only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties. “Web Beacons” (also known as
          Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services
          for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of
          our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.
          Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web
          pages (or in an e-mail).</p>

        <h3>Information Related to Use of the Services</h3>
        <p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information
          as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include
          information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that
          a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed
          and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and
          other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze)
          Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring
          them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity
          theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are
          used.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</h3>
        <p>We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier,
          user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>

        <h3>Location Information</h3>
        <p>In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address
          into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates (requires user opt-in) if you enable
          location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.
          If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>

        <h2>Information That We Share With Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p>

        <h3>Information Shared with Our Services Providers</h3>
        <p>We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party
          services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</p>

        <h3>Information shared by you with Friends and in User Forums</h3>
        <p>Awesome Services allow you to share your diet and exercise goals and information with friends that you select. Please
          bear in mind that Awesome cannot control what your friends do with the information you share with them, so you
          should only share with friends you trust.</p>

        <h3>Information Shared with Other Systems, Such As HealthKit or Google Fit</h3>
        <p>You may instruct us to share certain of your information with systems such as Apple’s HealthKit or Google Fit, and
          to access information from those systems which we will use to improve the services we provide to you. Before you
          tell us to share your information with another system, however, you should review the applicable privacy policy
          of that system, since any information you have instructed us to share will become subject to those policies (Apple’s
          policy can be found
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">here</a> and Google’s Privacy Policy can be found
          <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">here</a>). In addition, in the event that you use one of those services, you should be careful about allowing other
          applications, services or people to access your information through that service. While much information collected
          by those services is innocuous, people who see Awesome data may be able to determine a variety of personal information.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Awesome does not use or disclose to third parties user data or other information gained through the use of the
            HealthKit framework or Google Fit for advertising, other use-based data mining purposes or similar services,
            other than for purposes of improving health or for purposes of health or medical research.</li>
          <li>We do not disclose any of your information, to any third party without your express permission (other than in anonymized
            and aggregated format), and in the case of information gained through HealthKit or Google Fit such sharing will
            only be for purposes of enabling the third party to provide health and/or fitness services or for medical research.</li>
          <li>We do not sell any of your information, including information gained through HealthKit or Google Fit, to advertising
            platforms, data brokers or information resellers.
          </li>
          <li>We do not use any of the information obtained through HealthKit or Google Fit for any purpose other than providing
            health and/or fitness services in connection with the Services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Shared with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and
          analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>

        <h3>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</h3>
        <p>Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if
          we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger,
          acquisition or asset sale, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a
          third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>

        <h3>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h3>
        <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and/or private parties to enforce and comply with the
          law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as
          we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims or legal process (including
          subpoenas, warrants or court orders); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property
          and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to prevent or stop any activity we consider illegal,
          unethical or legally actionable activity.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party
          website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy
          policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content,
          privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend
          that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>

        <h2>Opt-Out</h2>
        <p>We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such
          promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (by following the unsubscribe instructions
          provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you
          will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service
          or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.</p>

        <h3>Modifying Your Information</h3>
        <p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account through your Account settings or by contacting us
          at hello@isjustawesome.com. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at hello@isjustawesome.com
          with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain
          in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>

        <h2>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>Our Services do not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.</p>

        <h2>The Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect
          from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information
          on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of
          transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot
          guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party
          Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party
          Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to that owner’s
          or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies
          of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies
          of all Third-party Services that you access.</p>

        <h2>International Transfer</h2>
        <p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or
          other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
          If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the
          United States and process it there.</p>

        <h2>Children and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If
          we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our
          files as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>Please contact us at hello@isjustawesome.com if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p>
